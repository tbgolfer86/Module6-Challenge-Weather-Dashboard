  ## Usage
  This app runs in the browser. The user can search for a city using the form on the page to retrieve current and future weather conditions for that city. Cities searched are added to the search history using local storage. When the user clicks on a city in the search history the current and future conditions for that city are again presented on the page. When viewing the weather conditions for a city the user is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, humidity, and wind speed.<br><br>
